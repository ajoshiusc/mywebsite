= Chitresh Bhushan -- About me

I am from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna Patna], capital city of state [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar Bihar], India. I have spent most of my initial days in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumhrar Kumhrar], a residential area of Patna, as well as a place of historical importance.

I went to [http://www.rkmvdeoghar.org/ Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith, Deoghar] a boarding school located in the temple town Deoghar, for my secondary education. It is one of the schools run by a social service organization named [http://www.rkmhq.org/ Ramakrishna Mission]. I developed a taste for science & mathematics during my secondary education and I decided to take engineering as my career.

In order to pursue engineering studies I went to [http://iitkgp.ac.in/ IIT Kharagpur] and opted to study [http://www.ecdept.iitkgp.ernet.in/ Electronics engineering]. IIT Kharagpur, better known as 'IITKgp' or simply 'KGP', is a place of all round development rather than only academic. I was Head member of Computer Vision group of KRAIG (Kharagpur Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Society). I like playing football and was a member of National Sports Organization,(2005-2007). At KGP, I was proud resident of [http://www.patelians.org/ Patel Hall], residents of which are sometimes also referred as /Patelians/.

I love to learn, explore & discover about different types of technologies with practical applications. Hence, it seemed to me that getting a Ph.D. in engineering is the most obvious next step. And here I am at [http://usc.edu USC] working on [research.html Brain Imaging]\!

I like to paint and sketch in my free time. [sketch.html Here] are some of my sketches and Colour Compositions. I am fond of music, be it Eastern, Western, Classsical or Rock. I also enjoy watching movies and trying out new cuisines.
